# CLASSES:

aegis:DataSet
	rdf:type rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf dcat:Dataset;
	rdfs:description
“Type of the datasets that are hosted in an AEGIS platform.” .

aegis:TabularDataSet
	rdf:type rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf aegis:DataSet;
	rdfs:description
“Type of AEGIS datasets that contain tabular data,
e.g., a CSV table, or a table in a relational database.” .

aegis:Factor
	rdf:type rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:description
“AEGIS sees tabular data as tabulated relations.
Relations may even be functions when certain uniqueness properties are met.
Rrelations (or functions) conceptually are subsets of product spaces.
In tabular data, every row represents a tuple contained in that subset.
Every column represents a factor space of the product space.
It shall hence be typed as aegis:Factor,
and «what is in the column» shall be described by the other aegis: classes and properties.
(Relations don't have columns; tables do.)” .

aegis:FactorTypeClass rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class,
	rdfs:description
“The class of the types that AEGIS provides to describe table column content,
with the intention to support the detection of correlations via compatible columns.” .

# PROPERTIES:

aegis:hasKeyFactor
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:TabularDataSet;
	rdfs:range aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:seeAlso aegis:hasValueFactor;
	rdfs:description
“In database parlance, one or more (or all) of the columns of an AEGIS tabular dataset constitute its primary key.
These columns possess the well-known uniqueness property,
which effects that the tabulated relation is actually a function.
Tabular datasets are tabulated relations,
and their columns are the materializations of the factors of the underlying relation.
The property aegis:hasKeyFactor is used to link a tabular dataset
to each of the key factor(s) of the tabulated relation,
hence there may be more than one instance of the aegis:hasKeyFactor property
emanating from a particular dataset.” .

aegis:hasValueFactor 
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:TabularDataSet;
	rdfs:range aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:seeAlso aegis:hasKeyFactor;
	rdfs:description
“The property aegis:hasValueFactor is used to link a tabular dataset
to each of the non-key factor(s) of the tabulated relation.
There may be none, one, or more instances of the aegis:hasValueFactor property
emanating from a particular dataset.” .

aegis:columnNumber
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range xsd:integer;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor, materialized as a table column, 
to the number of the column within the table, starting with 1.“ .

aegis:factorType
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range aegis:Class;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor, materialized as a table column, 
to the type of the entries of the column.
Here, the members of aegis:FactorTypeClass or domain vocabularies are useful.“ .




# the following properties describe auxiliary information:

aegis:measuredOrCountedUnit
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range rdfs:Resource;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor (materialized as a table column)
with counts or measurements to the type of things being counted or measured.
This type may be specified by a generic entity, by an RDF class, or by a string.
Here, domain ontologies may be useful.“ .


aegis:factorDomain
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range rdfs:Resource;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor (materialized as a table column)
which contains elements of some domain to said domain.
The domain may be a formal RDF class from some domain ontology,
or it may be specified informally as a textual string.“ .


aegis:disambiguifier
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range rdfs:Resource;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor (materialized as a table column)
with proper names to an information that disambiguates these proper names.
Often this information consists in a restriction of the coverage.
It may be stated formally as a URI from some domain ontology,
or informally as a textual string.“ .


aegis:langTag
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range xsd:string;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor (materialized as a table column)
with counts or measurements to the type of things being counted or measured.
This type may be specified by a generic entity, by an RDF class, or by a string.
Here, domain ontologies may be useful.“ .
