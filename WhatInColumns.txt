# CLASSES:

aegis:DataSet
	rdf:type rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf dcat:Dataset;
	rdfs:description
“Type of the datasets that are hosted in an AEGIS platform.” .

aegis:TabularDataSet
	rdf:type rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf aegis:DataSet;
	rdfs:description
“Type of AEGIS datasets that contain tabular data,
e.g., a CSV table, or a table in a relational database.” .

aegis:Factor
	rdf:type rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:description
“AEGIS sees tabular data as tabulated relations (which may also be functions).
In relational database parlance, relations (or functions) conceptually are subsets of product spaces.
Every table row represents a tuple contained in that subset.
Every column of an AEGIS tabular dataset represents a factor space of the product space.
It shall hence be typed as aegis:Factor,
and «what is in the column» shall be described by the other aegis: classes and properties.
(Relations don't have columns; tables have.)” .

aegis:FactorTypeClass rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class,
	rdfs:description
“The class of the types that AEGIS provides to describe table column content,
with the intention to support the detection of correlations via compatible columns.” .

aegis:MeasureOrCount rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description “Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries count or measure something.”;
	rdfs:seeAlso aegis:MeasuredOrCountedUnit.

aegis:TimePointSpan rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description
“Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries describe a time point or time span in whatever resolution.” .

aegis:GeoName rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description
“Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries are proper names that designate geographic entities, e.g. cities, regions, or countries.” .

aegis:GeoCoordinates rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description “Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries are geographic coordinates (long/lat).” .

aegis:FreeText rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description “Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries are texts in any natural language.” .

aegis:Image rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description “Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries are (references to) images.” .

aegis:Video rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description “Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries are (references to) videos.” .

aegis:Audio rdf:type aegis:FactorTypeClass;
	rdfs:description“Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries are (references to) audios.” .

aegis:DatabaseKey rdf:type rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:description “Members of this class (type) are columns whose entries are foreign keys to some database table.” .


# PROPERTIES:

aegis:hasKeyFactor
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:TabularDataSet;
	rdfs:range aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:seeAlso aegis:hasValueFactor;
	rdfs:description
“In database parlance, one or more (or all) of the columns of an AEGIS tabular dataset constitute its primary key.
These columns possess the well-known uniqueness property,
which effects that the tabulated relation is actually a function.
Tabular datasets are tabulated relations,
and their columns are the materializations of the factors of the underlying relation.
The property aegis:hasKeyFactor is used to link a tabular dataset
to each of the key factor(s) of the tabulated relation,
hence there may be more than one instance of the aegis:hasKeyFactor property
emanating from a particular dataset.” .

aegis:hasValueFactor 
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:TabularDataSet;
	rdfs:range aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:seeAlso aegis:hasKeyFactor;
	rdfs:description
“The property aegis:hasValueFactor is used to link a tabular dataset
to each of the non-key factor(s) of the tabulated relation.
There may be none, one, or more instances of the aegis:hasValueFactor property
emanating from a particular dataset.” .

aegis:columnNumber
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range xsd:integer;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor, materialized as a table column, 
to the number of the column within the table, starting with 1.“ .

aegis:factorType
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range aegis:Class;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor, materialized as a table column, 
to the type of the entries of the column.
Here, the members of aegis:FactorTypeClass or domain vocabularies are useful.“ .

aegis:measuredOrCountedUnit
	rdf:type rdfs:Property;
	rdfs:domain aegis:Factor;
	rdfs:range rdfs:Resource;
	rdfs:description
“This property links an AEGIS factor (materialized as a table column)
with counts or measurements to the type of things being counted or measured.
This type may be specified by a generic entity, by an RDF class, or by a string.
Here, domain ontologies may be useful.“ .
